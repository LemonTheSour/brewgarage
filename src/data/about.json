        "body": "Im just as intrigued now, if not more, with the craft of beer brewing as I was at the age of 17 when the only way to get a frothy was to make your own. Back then, I went down to the local brew shop, bought my plastic fermenter, and away we went!  Many years of brewing, good times, hangovers, and later a graduate diploma of brewing, the beers have never tasted so good."

        "body": "Passion, passion, passion. Cracking that perfect drop, perfecting the recipes and recording everything, it’s not science unless you write it down.  Some things like brewing require hands-on experience to get the touch right. I guess that’s why we call it craft brewing: it’s a craft and the whole process inspires me very much. "
